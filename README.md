This project is a basic Library Catalog System implemented in java, designed to manage books within a library. The system allows you to create books, store them in a library, and catalog them for easy search and retrieval. The project is structured around three primary classes: Book, Library, and LibraryCatalog.
Book: Represents individual books in the system.
Library: Manages the collection of books.
LibraryCatalog: Provides an interface to search and interact with the books in the library.
Features:
Book Class: Represents a book with essential details like title, author, ISBN.
Library Class: Represents a collection of books and provides methods for adding and listing books.
LibraryCatalog Class: Enables searching and filtering of books by various parameters like title, author, and ISBN.
Challenges:
•	Managing the availability of books and ensuring correct responses to borrowing/return actions.
•	Ensuring efficient search operations for books by title and author.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a practical application of Java OOP principles in developing a library catalog system. It provides an interactive and functional interface to manage books, making it a valuable tool for library management
